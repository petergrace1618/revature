npm has 3 components
	cli interacts with remote register
	like maven manages dependencies and versions through package.json (like pom.xml)
	it installs packages in folder called node_module in ouur angular application.
angular is front-end framework that uses typescript to create web applications
browsers only understand JS so we transpile typescript into js. node and npm performs this compilation. 

typescript
open-source developed by microsoft. supports OOP. can't do polymorphism well. particularly method overloading. It's a superset of JS, i.e. it's like js except it has more methods. strictly typed.
